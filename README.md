## 👋 Hi, I'm Johan Janérs

I build tools for extracting insights and solving problems — using data systems, pipelines, and code.  
Exploring data workflows using Python, SQL, and Git.  
Focused on performance analysis using Python-based ETLs to extract KPIs, generate structured reports and metadata exports for SQL database.
