## 👋 Hi, I'm Johan Janérs

I build tools for extracting insights and solving problems — using data systems, pipelines, and code.  
Currently exploring data workflows using Python, SQL, and Git.  
Focused on performance analysis through Python ETLs that extract KPIs and generate structured reports and metadata exports for SQL integration.

### 🛠️ Projects

- **mf4_analyzer** — Python pipeline for processing `.mf4` EV system logs, extracting KPIs, and generating structured reports and SQL-ready metadata.  
  *Future extensions include dashboard generation and batch processing.*
- **mf4_visualizer** — Visualizes filtered signal data from `.mf4` logs with export and plotting tools.
- **johanjaners** — Personal GitHub config and profile setup.

### 📚 Currently Learning

- Modular data pipelines with SQL and database integration  
- Git workflows and automation for collaboration  
- Clean, efficient Python for maintainable codebases  
- Cloud workflows for data storage, automation, and deployment
